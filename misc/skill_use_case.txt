A sketch of the use case of Skill.

1. All Creatures are constructed with an empty SkillList.
2. Call addSkill(Skill) with a static Skill in createHeroAndStartingLocation().
3. AttackAlgorithm's attack() will check for Skills in the SkillSet.
4. If a Skill is found, a message will be printed and the target will be damaged by the Skill's damage.
