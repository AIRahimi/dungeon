// Divided into sections. Inside sections, ordered by alphabetical ordering of ID.
// Visibility is based on item size and reflection. Therefore, a cherry should be harder to spot than a sword.
// The higher this value, the easier to see something is. 100% means always visible and 0% means invisible.

\\
210-5-2: I finally feel compelled to respond to the offense Birgmar made! And I will not be gentle.\\
\\
210-5-3: Things did not go according to the plan. Birgmar was not alone, that bastard Orc was hosting this "Orc Reunion" thing and I was really surprised that after kicking in the door and screaming "You are gonna die, scum!" I had not one but twelve Orcs staring at me. I outran them but cannot go back home as they know where I live. My wife is probably dead now.\\
\\
210-5-4: Went back to my old place and found my wife's body nailed to the rooftop of our shack. I will find another woman later on, I've got bigger problems now. In the wooden door they wrote a threat: "We are coming for you."\\
\\
210-5-5: I woke in the middle of the night as I heard the breaking of dry wood branches in the ground below me, looked down and saw two Orcs. I then drew two arrows from my quiver, nocked them on the string of my longbow, silently drew the string back, and released with perfect timing. Silently and efficiently I killed both Orcs. I don't know if I will last much longer if they are all coming after me.
