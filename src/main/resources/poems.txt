TITLE:   A Coat
AUTHOR:  William Butler Yeats
CONTENT: \
I made my song a coat       \
Covered with embroideries   \
Out of old mythologies      \
From heel to throat;        \
But the fools caught it,    \
Wore it in the world’s eyes \
As though they’d wrought it.\
Song, let them take it      \
For there’s more enterprise \
In walking naked.

TITLE:   The road not taken
AUTHOR:  Robert Frost
CONTENT: \
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, \
And sorry I could not travel both    \
And be one traveler, long I stood    \
And looked down one as far as I could\
To where it bent in the undergrowth; \
Then took the other, as just as fair,\
And having perhaps the better claim, \
Because it was grassy and wanted wear\
Though as for that the passing there \
Had worn them really about the same, \
And both that morning equally lay    \
In leaves no step had trodden black. \
Oh, I kept the first for another day!\
Yet knowing how way leads onto way,  \
I doubted if I should ever come back.\
I shall be telling this with a sigh  \
Somewhere ages and ages hence;       \
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I  \
I took the one less traveled by,     \
And that has made all the difference.

TITLE:   To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time
AUTHOR:  Robert Herrick
CONTENT: \
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,      \
Old time is still a-flying;           \
And this same flower that smiles today\
Tomorrow will be dying.               \
The glorious lamp of heaven the sun,  \
The higher he's a-getting,            \
The sooner will his race be run,      \
And nearer he's to setting.           \
That age is best which is the first,  \
When youth and blood are warmer;      \
But being spent, the worse, and worst \
Times still succeed the former.       \
Then be not coy, but use your time,   \
And, while ye may, go marry;          \
For, having lost but once your prime, \
You may forever tarry.

TITLE:   A Dream Within A Dream
AUTHOR:  Edgar Allan Poe
CONTENT: \
Take this kiss upon the brow!  \
And, in parting from you now,  \
Thus much let me avow--        \
You are not wrong, who deem    \
That my days have been a dream;\
Yet if hope has flown away     \
In a night, or in a day,       \
In a vision, or in none,       \
Is it therefore the less gone? \
All that we see or seem        \
Is but a dream within a dream. \
I stand amid the roar          \
Of a surf-tormented shore,     \
And I hold within my hand      \
Grains of the golden sand--    \
How few! yet how they creep    \
Through my fingers to the deep,\
While I weep--while I weep!    \
O God! can I not grasp         \
Them with a tighter clasp?     \
O God! can I not save          \
One from the pitiless wave?    \
Is all that we see or seem     \
But a dream within a dream?

TITLE:   As The Sparrow
AUTHOR:  Charles Bukowski
CONTENT: \
To give life you must take life,                      \
and as our grief falls flat and hollow                \
upon the billion-blooded sea                          \
I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed     \
with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures    \
lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.\
Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow        \
did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be     \
young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.         \
I hated you when it would have taken less courage     \
to love.
