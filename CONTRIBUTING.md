Code Style
----------
Our code style is a slightly modified version of Google Java Style called
[Dungeon Java Style](https://github.com/mafagafogigante/dungeon/blob/master/STYLE.md).

My main settings in IDEA are in the `idea` directory.

Import the JAR into the IDE to get proper code reformatting and a project-specific inspection profile.

**Note that this is not 100% style compliant, you will still need to fix some things yourself, like Javadoc.**
